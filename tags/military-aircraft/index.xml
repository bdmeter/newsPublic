      <description>A US Marine’s Fight for Survival After a Horrific Crash On Sunday, August 27, 2023, a US Marine was critically injured when a military aircraft crashed during a multination exercise in Australia’s Northern Territory. The aircraft was a Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, which can take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but also fly like a plane. The Osprey crashed on Melville Island around mid-morning, during Exercise Predators Run, which involved the militaries of the United States, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and East Timor.</description>
